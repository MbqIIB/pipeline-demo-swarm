TODO

- Manual steps first to full env, then jenkins!

- create network (single host) per environment --> script, done
  check network connect?
- deploy etcd for an env --> done
- deploy vulcand for an env --> done
- deploy petclinic for an env --> done
- add petclinic to vulcand --> done


- add extra env (acc) and deploy all --> done

- add 'build' env for jenkins
- deploy jenkins
- bootstrap jenkins-jobs
- provide access to other networks for jenkins (docker host)
- full pipeline view

NEXT:
- run a test on petclinic
- create multi-host setup using docker-machine
  - configure IPs for hosts in jenkins (DOCKER_HOST, vulcan/etcd IPs will need to bind ports again? Or is that transparent?)
- create network (multi host) per environment
- add local registry so we can push?
- remove vagrant credentials from jenkins?
